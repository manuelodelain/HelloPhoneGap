        <div>First and foremost – it is essential to have at least some kind of idea what you are going to build before you build it. If you just start hacking things together without a plan, the final result is seldomly great. Complete (pixel perfect) UI/UX mockups are fantastic, but you don’t have to have a fully polished design and screen flow. Just having wireframes/sketches are a great start. Heck, even a sketch on a napkin is better than starting with nothing. <br>
The UX design/wireframes help you understand what you application should be doing from the user’s perspective, which in turn helps you make decisions on how you tackle a project. This can be purely from a HTML level, helping you figure out how you should position DOM elements and/or content. Or, it can help you gauge your project’s technical complexity – How many “moving parts” do you have, how much of the app is dynamic or asynchronus, or how do different visual elements need to work together? You can leverage this design/mockup to analyze the needs of your application and determine if a particular framework/development methodology is a best fit (Bootstrap, Backbone.js, Knockout.js, Sencha, jQuery Mobile, Angular.js, etc…).</div>
